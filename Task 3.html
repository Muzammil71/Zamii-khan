        <p> Books are <b>friends who never leave your side</b> I find this saying to be very true as books have always been there for me. I enjoy reading books. They have the power to help us travel through worlds without moving from our places. In addition, <b>books also enhance our imagination</b> Growing up, my parents and teachers always encouraged me to read. They taught me the importance of reading. Subsequently, I have read several books. However, one boom that will always be <b>my favourite book is Harry Potter</b> It is one of the most intriguing reads of my life. I have read all the books of this series, yet I read them again as I never get bored of it.</p>
